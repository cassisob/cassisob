Hi!

I'm a Data Intelligence Analyst with a background in systems analysis and process engineering in the automotive industry. I work on digital transformation initiatives, focusing on data integration, automation, analysis and the development of customized internal systems.

My main tools are Python and SQL. I also have experience with data visualization, real-time monitoring, manufacturing execution systems (Plex by Rockwell Automation) and SAP. I'm passionate about solving complex problems and using data to drive efficiency and better decision-making.

Feel free to check out some of my work or connect with me on LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/cassiano-sobierai

You can also check out @copinhaesports on Instagram — a community I created to support local e-sports. Over 90 teams have participated and we’ve hosted 5 in-person events (4 of which were held in gymnasiums!).

See you online ;)
Cassiano.
